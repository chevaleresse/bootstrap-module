This is a website build with bootstrap to gain an understanding of, and learn how to use, bootstrap. The README.md file is left in tact for the majority of text, as it contains some useful tips about how to use Gitpod, like how to run in the terminal.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates since 20/03
The site was set up before the 20th of March. On the 20th of March, the first index.html and style.css files were created and committed.

Happy coding!
